# Hush login configuration
# Suppresses login messages and system information
# 
# This file's presence tells the system to skip displaying:
# - Last login information
# - System messages (/etc/motd)
# - Mail notifications
# - Other login banners
#
# Benefits:
# - Cleaner terminal startup
# - Faster login process
# - Reduced noise for automated scripts
# - Professional appearance for demonstrations
#
# Note: This file only needs to exist - content is ignored
# The system checks for ~/.hushlogin and suppresses messages if found
